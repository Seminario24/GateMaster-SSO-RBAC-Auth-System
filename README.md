# Single Sign-On (SSO) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in a Distributed System

This document provides an overview of a distributed system that implements Single Sign-On (SSO) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using Keycloak and Redis.

## System Components
#### 1. API Gateway
- **Rate Limiting**: Limits the number of requests from a single IP address within a specific time window to prevent abuse.
- **Authentication**: Validates user access tokens before forwarding requests to backend services.
- **Proxying Requests**: Routes requests to the appropriate backend services based on the request path.
- **Data Caching**: Caches user data, such as user roles, in a centralized cache with a Time-To-Live (TTL) equal to or less than the token's expiration time.

#### 2. Authentication Service
- **User Login**: Authenticates users with their username and password, generating access and refresh tokens via Keycloak.
- **Token Refreshing**: Allows clients to refresh access tokens using refresh tokens.
- **Token Verification**: Validates access tokens using Keycloak’s introspection endpoint to ensure correct signing and active user status.
- **Admin Routes**: Provides routes for administrative tasks, such as fetching and suspending users.

#### 3. Service A
- **Authentication**: Retrieves user data from Redis using the access token as the key.
- **Authorization**: Uses middleware to verify if the user has the required role to access specific routes.

#### 4. Keycloak Server
- **User Authentication**: Verifies user credentials and generates access tokens.
- **User Management**: Handles user accounts, roles, and permissions.
- **Role Management**: Manages user roles and permissions.
- **Multiple Login Strategies**: Supports various login methods.

#### 5. Redis Cache
- **Centralized Cache Management**: Manages cached user data centrally to improve performance.

## Request-Response Flow
### 1. User Login:

- User logs in via username/password or Google OAuth. The API Gateway routes the request to the Authentication Service.
- For username/password, the Authentication Service generates tokens using Keycloak. For Google OAuth, the Authentication Service exchanges the Google token for Keycloak tokens.
- Tokens are returned to the API Gateway, which stores user data in the cache.

### 2. Accessing Service A:

- The API Gateway checks for the access token and routes the request to Service A if valid.
- Service A retrieves user data from the cache and applies RBAC as necessary.

### 3. Subsequent Requests:
- Users can continue using their existing access token for subsequent requests, with the same flow as above.

### 4. Additional Auth Service Routes:
- Refresh Token: Issues new access tokens using a refresh token.
- Verify Token: Verifies the validity of a token if it is not found in the cache.

## User Suspension
### Suspension Process:
- An admin suspends a user using the “suspend user” route.
- The Authentication Service disables the user account in Keycloak and evicts the token from the cache.
- If a suspended user attempts to access protected resources, the API Gateway verifies the token with the Authentication Service.
- The Authentication Service confirms the token’s invalidity with Keycloak, resulting in the API Gateway rejecting the request.

## Design Decisions
1. **Cache Reading in API Gateway**: Reduces latency by avoiding an extra hop to the Authentication Service.
2. **Service-Specific RBAC**: Implements RBAC tailored to each service’s requirements.
3. **Security**: Immediate reflection of user suspension and caching of tokens for reduced latency.
4. **Stateless Authentication**: Ensures scalability and stateless authentication using Keycloak.
5. **Centralized Cache Management**: Enhances performance and simplifies user data management with Redis.
